# Topics now have date ranges
<byline>Eric Walker, September 1, 2019</byline>

Something I learned from using [Digraph](https://digraph.app/) for a few months that didn't occur to me when I started out is that some of the topics that I want to track are situated in time:

- [1969 Swann Committee report](https://digraph.app/wiki/topics/c6ccb924-a2e7-49ce-8ab9-b1a44379e711)
- [1863 False Claims Act](https://digraph.app/wiki/topics/bd7ac424-a264-4f8e-88fa-abae4cfe6c6f)
- [2019-06 EFSA report on monitoring of antimicrobial resistance
](https://digraph.app/wiki/topics/ebd4618d-4381-4802-9a84-8054df61fca0)

In order to capture this dimension of time, I started using a convention of adding prefixes to some topic names to capture the approximate date.  A nice thing about this convention is that the topics with date prefixes sort chronologically, providing an informal timeline.

Eventually I'd like to be able to reconstruct timelines with more precision, and this will require keeping track of the actual dates involved.  As a first step, I've added a new set of form fields to the topic edit form:

</a>

Following are some of the timeline-related features that I'd like to add at some point:
- Producing a timeline of events that are relevant to a specific search or topic
- Keeping track of specific events with a start and an end date
- Keeping track of a series of related events that occur over months or years
- Keeping track of historical periods that span thousands of years
- Keeping track of geological periods that span millions of years
- The ability to answer the question of which topics have dates that overlap with a specific date, together with the links associated with them
