# Links to review and recent activity updated
<byline>Eric Walker, August 4, 2019</byline>

Two views I use a lot are links to review and recent activity, which can be reached via the "Recent" and "Review" links at the top of the page.  But I've added enough links at this point that the review list was getting a little too long.  Now both views can also be filtered by the present topic:

When you click on either of these links, only recent activity and links to be reviewed that fall within the current topic and any of its subtopics are shown:
