# About Digraph
<byline>Eric Walker, March 2, 2019</byline>

Manage links in a mind-map-like network of topics. Tag articles, studies and videos for long-term retrievability. Transform information into knowledge by turning the ephemeral stream things you read every day into a growing collection whose structure makes it easy to navigate and find things.

## How it works

This video gives a brief intro to Digraph:

This is just the tip of the iceberg, and more is in the works.

## Getting started

Log in with [Github](https://digraph.app/auth/github) to get started. You can also take a look at some of the links and topics that have been added to the public collection [here](https://digraph.app/). Links and topics can be public or private.

Questions or comments? You can reach me [here](mailto:eric.walker@gmail.com).
