# "Links to review" section added
<byline>Eric Walker, June 7, 2019</byline>

During my day job as a software developer, I'll often find myself waiting for a long-running process to complete.
During such moments I might head over to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) to see what the
latest headlines are, and two or three might catch my attention.  I usually don't have more than a few minutes
to skim an article and the comments, but I'll often want to come back to them later on.

To help with this situation, a new section called "Links to review" has been added to
[Digraph](https://digraph.app/):

![Links to review](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/760949/59140394-d8913380-8959-11e9-8e45-c41bc63dff2e.png "Links to review")


Each time you add a link to Digraph, it will be added to this list so that you can get back to it later.
Once you've had a chance to look at the article a little more closely and maybe read it, you can mark it
"reviewed" and remove it from the list.

To get to the new view, you'll need to be signed in.  Once you're signed in, a link will appear at the
top of the page that will take you to the new view:
