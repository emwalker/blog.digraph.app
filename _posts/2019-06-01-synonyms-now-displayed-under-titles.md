# Synonyms now displayed under titles
<byline>Eric Walker, June 1, 2019</byline>

Not long ago, the ability to add [synonyms for a topic](2019-05-26-topic-names-and-synonyms.html) was introduced.
As of today, any synonyms are now displayed beneath the title for a topic page:

![Topic with several synonyms](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/760949/58750520-cc384280-8450-11e9-8954-739168c7eb7c.png "Topic with several synonyms")
