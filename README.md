# Jekyll source for the Digraph blog

This is the Jekyll source for the [Digraph blog](https://blog.digraph.app/).  You probably won't find
much interesting here, but the code is released under the same CC0-1.0 license as the
[Minimal theme repo](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) from which it is forked.

One thing that might be of interest to people — the hand-rolled CSS from the minimal theme
has been replaced with GitHub's [Primer](https://primer.style/).
